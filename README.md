## Hi there 👋
I am Fahnam Naqvi, as you now know by my username.
I am currently a student at Hult International Business School, and in my second semester doing CM3. 
I love to read, write and and talk to people on deep and meaningfull conversations. 
I have never done coding or any other stuff like that before, so I would love if someone could make it kindergardern level for me to understand it better.
